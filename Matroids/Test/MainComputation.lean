/-! # Running the main computation

This file runs the main computation of the project, producing a list of the "VÃ¡mos-like" matroids.
(There should be 39 of them, and the `#guard_msgs` command will fail if this is not the case.)

This file takes a *long* time to run, about 2 hours.  It is deliberately not included in a standard
build of the project. -/
