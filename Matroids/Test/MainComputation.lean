/-! # Running the main computation

This file runs the main computation of the project, producing a list of the "VÃ¡mos-like" matroids.
(There should be 39 of them, and the `#guard_msgs` command will fail if this is not the case.)
maxHeartbeats 30000 limits the number of steps this computation can perform. Will throw an error if
it goes above that number
